# Lars Dietrich

I am a researcher in botany and science education. My research focuses on treelines on the one hand and on ecological education, plant awareness, and the use of AI-supported learning environments in higher education teaching on the other hand.

## Research interests

- Molecular underpinnings of the global treeline phenomenon
- Ecological literacy and scientific literacy
- Plant awareness and perception
- Biology and chemistry education in higher education
- AI-supported learning environments (e.g., chatbots as learning companions)

- ## Navigation

- [Publications](/publications)

## Selected publications

- Dietrich, L., et al. (2025). *Investigating plant awareness: Image composition affects student perceptions of plants and animals in landscapes.* Plants, People, Planet.

## Teaching

I am involved in the biology education programs at Justus Liebig University Gießen and the Alpine Plant Ecology Course at the ALPFOR Research Station in Switzerland.
